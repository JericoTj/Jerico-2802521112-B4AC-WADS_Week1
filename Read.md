## Article: Web Application Development and Security

### Introduction
Web application development is the process of building applications that run on web browsers and communicate with servers over the internet. With the rapid growth of online services, web security has become a critical aspect of modern application development.

### Web Application Development
Modern web applications commonly use technologies such as **GitHub/Git**, **Microservices**, **Node.js**, **FastAPI**, and **React.js**.  
- **Git & GitHub** help developers collaborate and track changes efficiently.  
- **Microservices architecture** breaks applications into smaller, independent services.  
- **React.js** is widely used for building interactive user interfaces.  
- **FastAPI** enables fast and secure backend API development using Python.
